I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things about this city is just how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what's going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You've seen them. I was in a bar last night and saw this beautiful woman, like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, hey, where are you from? What do you do? She goes, oh, me, I live here in San Francisco. I'm a brain surgeon. Now, I don't know if this makes me sexist, but I was, like, really impressed, you know? I mean, most women can't pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that's just me clearing my throat. That joke's the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. Don't laugh at that joke. Whole show goes bad. And I've had shows go very, very bad. Doesn't matter to me at all.

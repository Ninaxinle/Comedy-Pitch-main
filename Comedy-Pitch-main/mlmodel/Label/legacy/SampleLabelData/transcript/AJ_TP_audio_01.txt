Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told them I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. I said, why would you do that? That's the most politically correct city in the world. Not when I'm on stage, it's not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. Just a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it's been a great day. I love that. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby's whole weekend. It was worth it.

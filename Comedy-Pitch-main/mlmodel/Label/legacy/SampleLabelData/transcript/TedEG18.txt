but I don't kid myself for a minute to think that I'm in control of anything that's ever happening. My realm of control is extremely small. It's usually about, like, might be able to go get a glass of water right now. Like, there's not a lot. There's not a lot that I'm in control of, and I'm actually... I've never been. I'm life-saving. One more question from online, if I may, and then I will jump off again. You know, Chris, you and I, we're all in a pretty privileged position. Ted has been able to go remote. We're able to work remotely. But many, many, many millions of people in the US and beyond are not able to do that. And people are really suffering. How can we help? What are your thoughts about people who are not able to socially distance, who are losing their jobs, the kind of global catastrophe that is unveiling? How can we think about that in a humane, compassionate way? It's crushing. And again, as with the same case of the person who said they had lost five family members, I can't. sitting in this position of comfort and safety, say anything that I think is going to be accurate and appropriate to that, other than to say that... I just think of this Indian proverb that I keep going back to, which is, I store my grain in the belly of my neighbor. You know, Western... capitalistic society has taught and trained us to hoard long before this. Long before this happened and people were hoarding toilet paper and canned goods, advertising and the whole capitalist model has taught us scarcity. It's taught us that you have to be surrounded by abundance in order to be safe. The disconnect between those who have and those who have not has never been bigger. And, you know, never in my lifetime and probably in any of our lifetimes has there been an invitation again to release the stranglehold on your hoarding.

Now I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you're a big comedy fan and batshit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? You're disabled. I know you're disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do so I can move the fuck on? You're an electrician. Great. That's an honorable job. That's a good job to have. I'm sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician is a wonderful job. There's a lot of bad jobs out there. I'll tell you that right now. A lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He's like... Says he's never worked a day in his life. Doesn't pay that much, but the benefits... Thank you.

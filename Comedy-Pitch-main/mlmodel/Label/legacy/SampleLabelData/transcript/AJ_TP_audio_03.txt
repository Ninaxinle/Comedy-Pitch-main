Now this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that's good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died the same way Eric Clapton's son died. Not for inspiration. I'm not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kind of laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping. That is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn't understand the joke, don't worry. It's a complicated joke. A lot of things you got to know. That joke is like an onion. You've got to know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You've got to know about his kid. You got to know how clumsy that little lad was. You've got to know about that terrible fucking song. And then you've got to think all that's funny.

Your task is to write a short context summary that provides important background information and recurring references that appear throughout the performance. This summary will be used to help understand individual joke segments, especially when a segment references something introduced earlier in the show.

ðŸ“Œ Your context summary should:
 - Identify major themes or topics the comedian talks about (e.g., family, dating, travel, politics)
- Mention any recurring characters, stories, or inside references (e.g., the comedianâ€™s mom, a coworker, a pet, a city)
- Include any ongoing narratives or callbacks that are important for understanding later jokes
- Be written in clear, concise language for someone who will read a single segment in isolation
- Avoid retelling the whole transcript â€” instead, provide just enough information to ground all segments in context

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: This context will be shown before individual joke segments, so readers can understand all references even if they didnâ€™t read the full performance.
Now, write the global context summary for the following transcript:

You are given a list of sentences. Your task is to find the best point to split the list into two chunks of similar size, based on the topic or content of the sentences. Return only the index of the sentence after which the split should occur (i.e., the index of the last sentence in the first chunk). The goal is to make the two chunks topically cohesive and roughly equal in length.

Return only a single integer index, and nothing else.

Your task is to group the sentences into distinct jokes.

IMPORTANT SEGMENT LENGTH RULES:
- Each joke segment should NOT exceed 120 seconds (2 minutes) in duration
- Each segment should contain NO MORE than 50 sentences
- For long comedy shows (30+ minutes), aim for segments of 60-90 seconds (1-1.5 minutes)
- If a segment would exceed these limits, you MUST split it at the next natural boundary
- When in doubt, split rather than merge - shorter segments are better than longer ones

A joke usually includes:
- One or more setup sentences
- One or more punchlines  
- Optional tags (short follow-up lines delivered after the punchline to extend the laugh)

ðŸ§  Use the following cues to decide where jokes begin and end:

**PRIMARY SPLITTING CUES (use these first):**
- **Topic changes** â€” when the comedian switches to a completely different subject, story, or theme
- **Large timing gaps** â€” sentences with "gap_to_next" > 2 seconds often indicate joke endings with audience laughter
- **Rhetorical questions** â€” when a comedian asks a question and then moves to answer it, this often starts a new joke
- **Personal story transitions** â€” "So I was..." or "This one time..." often signal new joke beginnings
- **Callbacks or references** â€” when referencing a previous joke, this usually starts a new segment

**SECONDARY CUES (use when primary cues aren't clear):**
- **Emotional shifts** â€” changes in tone, energy, or emotional content
- **Physical movement cues** â€” references to moving around stage, changing positions
- **Audience interaction** â€” direct comments to audience often start new segments
- **Time references** â€” "Back then...", "Last week...", "When I was younger..." often signal new stories

**AVOID SPLITTING:**
- In the middle of a setup and punchline
- During rapid-fire tag lines that extend the same joke
- When sentences are clearly continuing the same thought or story
- During callbacks that reference the current joke

**FOR LONG SHOWS (30+ minutes):**
- Be more aggressive about splitting - aim for 60-90 second segments
- Look for ANY natural pause or topic shift as an opportunity to split
- Don't let segments grow beyond 100 seconds even if the content seems connected
- Remember: audiences prefer digestible chunks, not marathon segments

Output:
Return list of joke segments using the format:
[
  {
    "segment_id": 1,
    "sentence_indexes": [0, 1, 2]
  },
  ...
]

- Use the sentence index values exactly as provided
- Do not skip any sentences â€” every sentence must belong to exactly one joke
- Do not include commentary or explanation â€” return only a list of joke objects
- Do not wrapped it in markdown code blocks (```json)

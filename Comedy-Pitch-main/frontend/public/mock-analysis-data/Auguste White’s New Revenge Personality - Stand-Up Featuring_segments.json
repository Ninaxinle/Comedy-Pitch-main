Guys, you know, we've got less than 100 days, okay, until the midterm elections, okay? It's quickly coming upon us, and I'm Gen Z, and Gen Z is kind of famously skeptical about voting, and I get it, because for a long time I was the same way. I kind of approached voting the same way that I approached Hinge and dating apps, right? Like ultimately just pick the dude you are least afraid to be in an elevator with and move on. You know what I mean? But I actually think that Gen Z can create more change than we might otherwise think. I was thinking about it the other day and I realized that Gen Z got rid of skinny jeans quicker than Abraham Lincoln got rid of slavery. You know what I mean? He kind of dragged his feet a little bit. Did he not? He did. He took his time. But Gen Z, when we see a problem, we immediately eliminate it, right? Like, it took probably a good couple hundred years to get rid of slavery. Took a couple hundred years for women, some women, to get the right to vote. Took hundreds of years for the U.S. to become an independent nation. Gen Z got rid of wearing bras... Drinking regular milk and generally liking things between the release of the first Avatar movie and the trailer for the second. That is a very ambitious timeline, right? I can't remember the last time that I used capital letters and punctuation in a text message. Gen Z got rid of that. Because ultimately, at this point, it's like if you're still wearing bras, you need to grow up, right? And if you're using capital letters and punctuation, you need to calm down.",

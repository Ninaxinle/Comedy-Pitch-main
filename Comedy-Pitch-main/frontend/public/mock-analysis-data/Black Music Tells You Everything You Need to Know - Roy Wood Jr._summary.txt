The comedian's performance centers around themes of racial identity, historical context, and cultural expression, particularly focusing on the African American experience in the United States. A major topic is the longstanding issues faced by black communities, with an emphasis on how these issues are reflected in music. The comedian highlights the invention of the blues as a significant cultural expression of sadness and struggle, contrasting it with the upbeat nature of traditional African music. 

A recurring reference throughout the performance is the idea that black music serves as a "telegram" of the black psyche, often lacking in patriotic themes due to a complex relationship with America. The comedian humorously critiques the expectation of patriotism from black artists, suggesting that black music instead celebrates specific cities known for vibrant culture and nightlife, such as Miami and Los Angeles. 

There are callbacks to specific songs and artists, like Ray Charles's "Georgia On My Mind" and James Brown's "Living in America," used to illustrate points about the nuanced relationship between black culture and American identity. The comedian also uses the narrative of James Brown's song as a metaphorical guide to safe spaces for black people, adding a layer of social commentary to the humor.

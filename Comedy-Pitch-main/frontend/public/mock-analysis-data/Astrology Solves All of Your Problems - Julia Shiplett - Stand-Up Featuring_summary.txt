The comedian's performance revolves around themes of astrology, therapy, family dynamics, dating, and the nature of gossip. They humorously explore their identity as a Gemini, using astrology as a lens to discuss personal traits and life choices, such as commitment issues and intimacy fears. The comedian frequently references their mixed cultural background, with a Christian Chinese mother and a German Irish father from Ohio, to highlight differing views on therapy and emotional expression. This cultural contrast is a recurring element, often used to set up jokes about their upbringing and family. 

The comedian also shares experiences of being single and dating, particularly in the context of the pandemic, using these anecdotes to comment on modern life, such as the inconvenience of physical keys in a digital age. A recurring joke involves their Amazon Echo, illustrating the absurdity of technology that can provide trivial information but not practical solutions. 

Gossip is another major theme, with the comedian defending it as a natural and enjoyable part of life, comparing it to conspiracy theories to highlight societal double standards. Historical figures are humorously reimagined as gossips to underscore the universality of the behavior. These elements create a tapestry of personal and societal observations, tied together with callbacks to astrology and their family background.
